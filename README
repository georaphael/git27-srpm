SRPM tools for git 2.1.x

This github repo includes tools for building git-2.1.x RPM's. It is
based on the iuscommunity packages at
http://dl.iuscommunity.org/pub/os/archive/CentOS/6/SRPMS/

The primary tarball can be built from the git tag in the primary git repo at https://github.com/git/git. The secondary tarballs are empty and not curently used, they're place holders until the googlecode repo catches up.

Download this git repo, download or build the tarballs, and run "make
build" to build a local RPM. Run "make" to use "mock" to build the
default designated RPM's in the local directory.
